```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
  cd stock-merch-ugs
```

3. Install the dependencies using the command below:

```bash
  npm install
```

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```bash
  # Convex for Development
  CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=<your_convex_deployment>
  VITE_CONVEX_URL=<your_convex_url>
  CONVEX_SITE_URL=<your_convex_site_url>

  CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your_clerk_webhook_secret> # Webhook secret for Clerk - DEV
  VITE_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=<your_clerk_frontend_api_url> #API URL for the Clerk frontend - DEV
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your_clerk_publishable_key> # Publishable key for the Clerk frontend - DEV
  VITE_CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your_clerk_secret_key> # Secret key for the Clerk frontend - DEV
```

5. Run the project using the command below:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the project in action.
7. To run the tests, use the command below:

```bash
  npm run test
```

8. To run the linter, use the command below:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Importing Large Data Sets into Your Database

If you need to import a large amount of data into your database, you can use the `npx convex import` command. This is particularly useful if you have an array of JSON objects or other supported formats that you would otherwise manually input via the dashboard.

#### Supported Data Formats

The `npx convex import` command supports the following data formats:

- **CSV**: Comma-separated values file.
- **JSON Array**: A file containing an array of JSON objects.
- **JSONL**: A file with one JSON object per line.
- **ZIP**: A zip file in the format generated by `npx convex export`.

#### Key Features

1. **Multiple Tables**: If you use a zip file, the command can import data into multiple tables at once.
2. **Replace or Append**: Use the `--replace` or `--append` flags to specify whether to overwrite existing data or add to it.
3. **Production Database**: To import data into the production database, you must include the `--prod` flag.
4. **Preserve References**: When re-importing data exported with `npx convex export`, ID references and creation timestamps are preserved.

#### Example Commands

To import data into your database, use the following commands:

- **Export Data**: Capture a snapshot of your current database.

  ```bash
  npx convex export --path <~/path/to/store>
  ```

- **Import Data**: Import the data into your database.

  ```bash
  npx convex import --path <~/path/to/store>
  ```

- **Replace Existing Data**: Overwrite the data in the target table.

  ```bash
  npx convex import --path <~/path/to/store> --replace
  ```

- **Append to Existing Data**: Add new data without overwriting.

  ```bash
  npx convex import --path <~/path/to/store> --append
  ```

- **Import into Production**: Ensure you include the `--prod` flag for production databases.
  ```bash
  npx convex import --path <~/path/to/store> --prod
  ```
